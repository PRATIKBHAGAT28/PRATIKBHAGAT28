Hello everyone! 
I'm Pratik Bhagat, a dedicated Full stack Engineer with a passion for building transformative web solutions. My skill set encompasses a range of technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js. I specialize in database management, particularly MongoDB, PostgreSQL with TypeORM.

Having spent a year in the vibrant startup ecosystem, I had the privilege of serving as a team leader at Kisan Kart, a Mumbai-based startup. In this role, I not only strengthened my technical expertise but also cultivated essential business skills and values integral to the startup landscape such as business ethics and integrity. 

I'm excited about the endless possibilities in the startup realm and remain adaptable to embracing new technologies. Let's connect and innovate towards building a dynamic future!
